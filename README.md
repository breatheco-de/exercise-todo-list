Create a TODO list application that allows users to add and delete tasks.

## 🌱  How to start this project

Do not clone this repository because we are going to be using a different template.

We recommend opening the `react.js boilerplate` using a provisioning tool like [Codespaces](https://4geeks.com/lesson/what-is-github-codespaces) (recommended) or [Gitpod](https://4geeks.com/lesson/how-to-use-gitpod). Alternatively, you can clone it on your local computer using the `git clone` command.

This is the repository you need to open or clone:

```

```

**👉 Please follow these steps on** [how to start a coding project](https://4geeks.com/lesson/how-to-start-a-project).


💡 Important: Remember to save and upload your code to GitHub by creating a new repository, updating the remote (`git remote set-url origin <your new url>`), and uploading the code to your new repository using the `add`, `commit` and `push` commands from the git terminal.

## 📝 Instructions

- You app needs to look [like this](https://github.com/breatheco-de/exercise-todo-list/blob/master/preview.gif?raw=true).
- The tasks are added when the user press enter on the keyboard, or you can have your own button.
- The delete icon shows only when the task is hovered.
- The user can add as many tasks as he/she wants.
- When there are no tasks the list should say "No tasks, add a task"
- There is no way to update a task, the user will have to delete and create again.

## 💡 Tips to finish this project

Do not go straight to the code, think first and have a viable strategy.

- What components will you create? Draw the project on white paper and identify components.
- Where are the tasks going to be stored in your component?
- Read about [controlled components inputs in react.js](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6YxkyR_T8c), you will need to understand the concept.
