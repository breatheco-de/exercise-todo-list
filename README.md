## üå±  How to start this project

Do not clone this repository because we are going to be using a different template.

We recommend opening the `react.js boilerplate` using a provisioning tool like [Codespaces](https://4geeks.com/lesson/what-is-github-codespaces) (recommended) or [Gitpod](https://4geeks.com/lesson/how-to-use-gitpod). Alternatively, you can clone it on your local computer using the `git clone` command.

This is the repository you need to open or clone:

```

**üëâ Please follow these steps on** [how to start a coding project](https://4geeks.com/lesson/how-to-start-a-project).


> üí° Important: Remember to save and upload your code to GitHub by creating a new repository, updating the remote (`git remote set-url origin <your new url>`), and uploading the code to your new repository using the `add`, `commit` and `push` commands from the git terminal.

## üìù Instructions

- Your app needs to look [like this](https://github.com/breatheco-de/exercise-todo-list/blob/master/preview.gif?raw=true).
- The tasks are added when the user presses enter on the keyboard, or you can have your own button.
- The delete icon shows only when the task is hovered.
- The user can add as many tasks as they want.
- When there are no tasks the list should say "No tasks, add a task"
- There is no way to update a task, the user will have to delete and create again.

## üí° Tips to finish this project

Do not go straight to the code, think first and have a viable strategy.

- What components will you create? Draw the project on white paper and identify the components.
- Where are the tasks going to be stored in your component?
- Read about [controlled inputs in react.js](https://4geeks.com/lesson/controlled-vs-uncontrolled-inputs-react-js), you will need to understand the concept.
